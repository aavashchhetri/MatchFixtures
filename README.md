20 teams to be played so fixed a bye of 12 teams, where 8 random teams will play with one another in "Group Stage -I".
"Group Stage - II" will be played between the bye 12 teams and qualified 4 teams ie 12+4 = 16 teams.
"Quarter Final" games between the winners of "Group Stage - II" between 8 teams and only 4 will be qualified for Semi Finals.
"Semi Finals" games will be played between the qualified teams from Quarter Final games, Winners will proceedto Finals and losers will play against each other for Third Position.
